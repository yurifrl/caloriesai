# This app basic requirements 

1. User uploads multiple images in one request
2. Images are stored temporarily (Redis)
3. Images are queued for processing by LLM
4. Processing extracts information about each image
5. Results are displayed as a stack of images with their analysis
6. User can create multiple entries, each with its own set of images

That's it - an image analysis app that processes batches of images and presents the results.
